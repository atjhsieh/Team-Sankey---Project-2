Create new Python environment called "Sankey" for Project: `conda create -n Sankey python=3.6`
Activate environment: `source activate Sankey`
Install Libraries: `pip install pymongo flask gunicorn psycopg2`

These need to be done when we are ready to deploy:
`FLASK_APP=app.py flask run`
`pip freeze > requirements.txt`
